# Cloudflare Pages redirects for www/non-www canonicalization
# Note: www to non-www redirects should be configured in Cloudflare Dashboard
# Settings → Custom domains → configure preferred domain
# The _redirects file only supports relative URL redirects

# This file is intentionally left minimal since www redirects
# should be handled at the Cloudflare CDN level, not in _redirects

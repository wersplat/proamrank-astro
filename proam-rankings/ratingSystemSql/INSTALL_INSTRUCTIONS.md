# Player Global Rating System - Installation Instructions

## üõ†Ô∏è Step-by-Step Installation

The implementation has been split into separate files to make debugging easier. Run each file in order and verify it works before proceeding to the next.

### Method 1: Using Supabase SQL Editor (Recommended)

1. **Open Supabase Dashboard** ‚Üí SQL Editor

2. **Run Step 1** - Create Weight Table
   ```sql
   -- Copy and paste contents of: player_rating_step_by_step.sql
   ```
   ‚úÖ Verify: Should return 5 rows showing T1-T5 tiers

3. **Run Step 2** - Create Per-Game View
   ```sql
   -- Copy and paste contents of: step_3_per_game_view.sql
   ```
   ‚úÖ Verify: Should return game_count and player_count

4. **Run Step 3** - Create Rating View
   ```sql
   -- Copy and paste contents of: step_4_rating_view.sql
   ```
   ‚úÖ Verify: Should return rating distribution by tier

5. **Run Step 4** - Create Functions & Trigger
   ```sql
   -- Copy and paste contents of: step_5_function_and_trigger.sql
   ```
   ‚úÖ Verify: Should return top 10 players with updated ratings

### Method 2: Using psql Command Line

```bash
# Connect to your database
psql -h [your-db-host] -U postgres -d postgres

# Run each file in order
\i sql/player_rating_step_by_step.sql
\i sql/step_3_per_game_view.sql
\i sql/step_4_rating_view.sql
\i sql/step_5_function_and_trigger.sql
```

### Method 3: All-in-One (If no errors)

If you're confident and want to run everything at once:
```bash
psql -h [your-db-host] -U postgres -d postgres -f sql/player_global_rating_implementation.sql
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Error: "syntax error at or near..."
- **Solution**: Use the step-by-step files above
- Copy ONE file at a time into Supabase SQL Editor
- This avoids any encoding or special character issues

### Error: "relation does not exist"
- **Solution**: Make sure you ran the previous steps first
- Check that views were created: `\dv v_player_global_rating*`

### Error: "type does not exist"
- **Solution**: Make sure your database has these enums:
  ```sql
  SELECT typname FROM pg_type WHERE typname IN ('event_tier', 'salary_tier');
  ```

### Error: "column does not exist"
- **Solution**: Verify table structure:
  ```sql
  \d players
  \d player_stats
  \d tournaments
  ```

## ‚úÖ Verification Checklist

After installation, verify everything works:

```sql
-- 1. Check weight table
SELECT * FROM player_rating_weights;
-- Should return 5 rows (T1-T5)

-- 2. Check per-game view
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM v_player_global_rating_per_game;
-- Should return number of verified player stats

-- 3. Check rating view
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM v_player_global_rating;
-- Should return number of players with games

-- 4. Check function works
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM update_player_global_ratings();
-- Should return number of updated players

-- 5. Check trigger exists
SELECT tgname FROM pg_trigger WHERE tgname = 'trigger_auto_update_player_rating';
-- Should return 1 row

-- 6. View top players
SELECT gamertag, rating_tier, global_rating, total_games
FROM v_player_global_rating
ORDER BY global_rating DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

## üìä Expected Results

After successful installation:

- **Weights Table**: 5 tiers configured
- **Per-Game View**: One row per verified player stat
- **Rating View**: One row per player with games
- **Function**: Updates all player ratings
- **Trigger**: Auto-updates on stat verification

### Rating Distribution

You should see players distributed across tiers:
- **S+ (95+)**: Elite performers (few)
- **S (90-94)**: Top tier (small percentage)
- **A (85-89)**: All-stars (5-10%)
- **B (80-84)**: Starters (10-15%)
- **C (75-79)**: Role players (20-30%)
- **D (70-74)**: Bench (20-30%)
- **Unranked (<70)**: New/inactive (remainder)

## üîÑ Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Verify installation with queries above
2. ‚úÖ Review top players to ensure ratings make sense
3. ‚úÖ Adjust weights if needed (see README)
4. ‚úÖ Update frontend to display new ratings
5. ‚úÖ Set up daily cron job for decay updates

## üìû Support

If you encounter errors:

1. **Copy the exact error message**
2. **Note which step failed**
3. **Check which file caused the issue**
4. **Verify prerequisites (tables, enums exist)**

The step-by-step files make it much easier to identify where issues occur!

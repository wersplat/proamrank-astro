# Add Sentry integration to project (2025-10-10 08:50Z)

_**User (2025-10-10 03:02Z)**_

i want to add sentry to the project.
dsn: "https://15ecc8d420bd1ac21d6ca88698ca4566@o4509330775277568.ingest.us.sentry.io/4510164326023168"

_**Assistant (default)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user wants to add Sentry to their project. They've provided a DSN (Data Source Name) for Sentry configuration.

Since this is plan mode, I need to:
1. Understand the project structure
2. Determine how to integrate Sentry
3. Ask any clarifying questions if needed
4. Create a plan

Let me first understand what kind of project this is:
- It's an Astro project (astro.config.mjs)
- It's deployed to Cloudflare (wrangler.toml, functions/)
- Uses TypeScript
- Has both frontend components (React/TSX) and backend API routes
- Uses Supabase for database

For adding Sentry to an Astro + Cloudflare project, I need to consider:
1. Client-side monitoring (for the frontend)
2. Server-side monitoring (for API routes and SSR)
3. Cloudflare Workers/Functions monitoring

Key questions I should ask:
1. Do they want Sentry for both client-side and server-side, or just one?
2. Do they want to monitor Cloudflare Functions as well?

However, the default assumption should be comprehensive monitoring (both client and server), which is what most people want.

Let me do a small pre-read to understand the structure better before asking questions.</details></think>

I'll help you add Sentry to your Astro + Cloudflare project. Let me first check a few key files to understand your setup better.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Good, now I understand the setup:
1. Astro with SSR mode
2. Cloudflare adapter
3. React for client-side components
4. Has middleware already set up

For Sentry integration with Astro + Cloudflare, I need to consider:
1. Client-side monitoring (browser errors, performance)
2. Server-side monitoring (SSR errors, API routes)
3. Cloudflare Functions monitoring (the functions/ directory)

I should ask the user about their preferences:
1. Do they want both client and server-side monitoring?
2. Do they want to monitor Cloudflare Functions too?
3. What level of performance monitoring do they want (transactions, traces)?
4. Do they want source maps uploaded to Sentry?

However, the most reasonable default would be to set up comprehensive monitoring for both client and server. Let me ask the essential questions.</details></think>

---

Before I create the plan, I have a few quick questions to ensure I set up Sentry correctly for your needs:

1. Which parts do you want to monitor with Sentry?
   - a) Both client-side (browser) and server-side (SSR + API routes)
   - b) Client-side only
   - c) Server-side only

2. Do you want to monitor the Cloudflare Functions in the `functions/` directory?
   - a) Yes, monitor them too
   - b) No, just the main Astro app

3. Do you want source maps uploaded to Sentry for better error debugging?
   - a) Yes, upload source maps during build
   - b) No, skip source maps for now

4. What environment name should be used?
   - a) Auto-detect (production/preview/development)
   - b) Specify a custom name

_**User (2025-10-10 03:02Z)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user has answered my questions:
1. Both client-side and server-side monitoring
2. Monitor Cloudflare Functions too
3. Upload source maps during build
4. Environment should be "production"

Now I have enough information to create a comprehensive plan for adding Sentry to their Astro + Cloudflare project.

Let me create a plan that covers:
1. Installing Sentry packages (@sentry/astro for the main app, @sentry/cloudflare for functions)
2. Creating Sentry config files (client and server)
3. Integrating Sentry into astro.config.mjs
4. Adding Sentry to the middleware for server-side monitoring
5. Adding Sentry to Cloudflare Functions
6. Configuring source maps upload (need auth token)
7. Environment variables setup

I should mention that they'll need a SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN for uploading source maps.</details></think>

---

Now I'll create a comprehensive plan for adding Sentry to your project with full monitoring coverage.

_**Assistant (default)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user has provided the SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN. They're likely ready for me to execute the plan. However, I'm still in plan mode according to the system reminder, so I should not execute yet unless the user explicitly tells me to proceed.

Let me check if they want me to:
1. Update the plan to include this token
2. Start executing the plan

The user just provided the token value, which seems like they're giving me the information needed to proceed. But they haven't explicitly said "execute" or "go ahead" or "implement this". 

I should acknowledge the token and ask if they want me to proceed with implementation, or I could interpret this as them providing the final piece of information needed and ask if they're ready for me to execute.

Actually, looking at the context - they've answered all my questions and now provided the auth token. This seems like they're ready for execution. But the system reminder is clear: I must not make edits until explicitly instructed.

I'll acknowledge the token and confirm they want me to proceed.</details></think>

---

Perfect! You've provided the `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN`. I have all the information needed to implement the Sentry integration.

The plan is ready to execute. It will:
1. Install the necessary Sentry packages
2. Create client and server configuration files
3. Update your Astro config with the Sentry integration
4. Enhance your middleware with Sentry error handling
5. Add Sentry monitoring to all 4 Cloudflare Functions
6. Configure source maps upload using your auth token

Should I proceed with implementing this plan?

---

_**User (2025-10-10 03:02Z)**_

Implement the plan as specified. To-do's from the plan have already been created, do not create them again.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user wants me to proceed with implementing the plan. They've confirmed I should start executing. They also mentioned that the to-dos from the plan have already been created, so I should not create them again with the todo_write tool.

Let me start implementing:
1. Install packages
2. Create sentry.client.config.ts
3. Create sentry.server.config.ts
4. Update astro.config.mjs
5. Update src/middleware.ts
6. Update all 4 Cloudflare Functions

Let me start with the installation and then proceed with the configuration files.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Great! Packages are installed. Now let me create the configuration files and update the existing files. I'll need to:
1. Create sentry.client.config.ts
2. Create sentry.server.config.ts
3. Update astro.config.mjs
4. Update src/middleware.ts
5. Read and update the 4 Cloudflare Functions

+ # Sentry Integration Setup
+ 
+ This project has been integrated with Sentry for comprehensive error monitoring across all application layers.
+ 
+ ## What's Monitored
+ 
+ - **Client-side (Browser)**: All frontend JavaScript errors, including React components
+ - **Server-side (SSR)**: All server-side rendering errors in Astro pages
+ - **API Routes**: All API endpoint errors in the main Astro app
+ - **Cloudflare Functions**: All errors in Cloudflare Pages Functions (4 functions)
+ 
+ ## Configuration Files
+ 
+ ### 1. `sentry.client.config.ts`
+ Browser-side Sentry configuration with:
+ - Error tracking
+ - Performance monitoring (Browser Tracing)
+ - Session Replay (10% of sessions, 100% of error sessions)
+ - Environment: production
+ 
+ ### 2. `sentry.server.config.ts`
+ Server-side Sentry configuration with:
+ - Error tracking
+ - Performance monitoring
+ - Environment: production
+ 
+ ### 3. `astro.config.mjs`
+ Astro integration that automatically:
+ - Injects Sentry client/server configurations
+ - Generates source maps
+ - Uploads source maps to Sentry during build
+ 
+ ### 4. `src/middleware.ts`
+ Enhanced with Sentry middleware to capture SSR and API route errors
+ 
+ ### 5. Cloudflare Functions
+ All 4 functions have Sentry initialized:
+ - `functions/api/player-stats.ts`
+ - `functions/api/team-stats.ts`
+ - `functions/api/upload-direct.ts`
+ - `functions/scheduled/update-player-ratings.ts`
+ 
+ ## Environment Variables
+ 
+ ### Required for Build (Cloudflare Pages)
+ 
+ Add this to your Cloudflare Pages environment variables:

+ SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN=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

+ 
+ This token is used during the build process to upload source maps to Sentry.
+ 
+ ### How to Add in Cloudflare Pages
+ 
+ 1. Go to your Cloudflare Pages project
+ 2. Navigate to **Settings** → **Environment variables**
+ 3. Add `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` with the value above
+ 4. Apply to both **Production** and **Preview** environments
+ 5. Redeploy your site
+ 
+ ## Source Maps
+ 
+ Source maps are automatically:
+ - Generated during the build (`npm run build`)
+ - Uploaded to Sentry using `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN`
+ - Hidden from production (only Sentry receives them)
+ 
+ This allows you to see the original source code in error stack traces, even though the production code is minified.
+ 
+ ## Sentry Project Details
+ 
+ - **DSN**: `https://15ecc8d420bd1ac21d6ca88698ca4566@o4509330775277568.ingest.us.sentry.io/4510164326023168`
+ - **Environment**: production
+ - **Traces Sample Rate**: 100% (adjust in production if needed)
+ - **Replays Session Sample Rate**: 10%
+ - **Replays on Error Sample Rate**: 100%
+ 
+ ## Testing the Integration
+ 
+ After deployment, you can test if Sentry is working:
+ 
+ 1. **Test client-side**: Add `throw new Error("Test error")` in a React component
+ 2. **Test server-side**: Add `throw new Error("Test error")` in an Astro page
+ 3. **Test Functions**: Trigger an error in one of the API endpoints
+ 
+ Check your Sentry dashboard at: https://sentry.io/organizations/bodegacatsgc/issues/
+ 
+ ## Adjusting Sample Rates
+ 
+ For production, you may want to adjust the sample rates in the config files to reduce costs:
+ 
+ - **tracesSampleRate**: Percentage of transactions to capture (currently 100%)
+ - **replaysSessionSampleRate**: Percentage of normal sessions to record (currently 10%)
+ - **replaysOnErrorSampleRate**: Percentage of error sessions to record (currently 100%)
+ 
+ Edit `sentry.client.config.ts` and `sentry.server.config.ts` to adjust these values.
+ 
+ ## Troubleshooting
+ 
+ ### Source maps not uploading
+ 
+ - Ensure `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` is set in Cloudflare Pages environment variables
+ - Check build logs for Sentry upload errors
+ - Verify the auth token has `project:releases` and `org:read` scopes
+ 
+ ### Errors not appearing in Sentry
+ 
+ - Check the Sentry DSN is correct
+ - Verify the project is deployed and receiving traffic
+ - Check browser console for Sentry initialization errors
+ 
+ ### High quota usage
+ 
+ - Reduce `tracesSampleRate` in both config files
+ - Reduce `replaysSessionSampleRate` in client config
+ - Filter out certain errors using Sentry's inbound filters
+

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>I see some warnings:
1. "sentryMiddleware" is not exported - this is expected in the client build
2. "No project provided. Will not upload source maps. Please set the `project` option to your Sentry project slug."

I need to update the astro.config.mjs to include the project slug for Sentry source map uploads. Let me fix this.</details></think>

I need to fix a few issues. The build succeeded but there are warnings about source map uploads and the middleware. Let me fix these:

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Good! Now I need to fix the middleware warning. The issue is that `sentryMiddleware()` is not available in the client bundle. I need to check the Sentry Astro docs to see the correct way to handle this. Actually, looking at the warning more carefully, it seems like it's trying to use `sentryMiddleware` which might not be the right approach for Astro.

Let me check if there's a better way to integrate Sentry middleware in Astro. Actually, I think the Sentry integration for Astro automatically handles the middleware injection, so I might not need to manually add it to the middleware file. Let me revert that change and see if Sentry still works.</details></think>

Now I need to fix the middleware issue. The Sentry Astro integration actually handles middleware automatically, so we don't need to manually add it. Let me update the middleware:

Let me check Sentry project list to see if I can find the exact project slug. Actually, I can use the Sentry API or web interface. But for now, let me just document it properly and let the user know they need to update it.

The build completed successfully, so Sentry itself is working - it's just the source map upload that needs the correct project slug.

Let me create a summary of what was done.</details></think>

+ 
+ ## Configuration Details
+ 
+ ### Sentry DSN
+ ```
+ https://15ecc8d420bd1ac21d6ca88698ca4566@o4509330775277568.ingest.us.sentry.io/4510164326023168
+ ```
+ 
+ ### Environment
+ ```
+ production
+ ```
+ 
+ ### Sample Rates
+ - **Traces Sample Rate**: 100% (captures all transactions for performance monitoring)
+ - **Replays Session Sample Rate**: 10% (records 10% of normal sessions)
+ - **Replays on Error Sample Rate**: 100% (records all sessions with errors)
+ 
+ ### Source Maps
+ - Automatically generated during build
+ - Uploaded to Sentry for error debugging
+ - Hidden from production (only Sentry receives them)
+ 
+ ## Environment Variables Required
+ 
+ ### For Cloudflare Pages
+ 
+ Add this environment variable in your Cloudflare Pages dashboard:
+ 
+ ```bash
+ SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN=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
+ ```
+ 
+ **Where to add:**
+ 1. Cloudflare Pages → Your Project → Settings → Environment variables
+ 2. Add for both Production and Preview environments
+ 3. Redeploy after adding
+ 
+ ## ⚠️ Action Required
+ 
+ ### Update Sentry Project Slug
+ 
+ The current project slug is set to `javascript-astro` in `astro.config.mjs`. You need to verify this is correct:
+ 
+ 1. Go to: https://sentry.io/settings/bodegacatsgc/projects/
+ 2. Find your project in the list
+ 3. Note the project slug (visible in the URL or project settings)
+ 4. Update `astro.config.mjs` line 14:
+    ```javascript
+    project: "your-actual-project-slug",
+    ```
+ 
+ If the project slug is incorrect, source maps won't upload (but error tracking will still work).
+ 
+ ## Build Status
+ 
+ ✅ **Build Successful** - The project builds correctly with Sentry integration
+ ⚠️ **Source Map Upload** - Will work once the correct project slug is configured
+ 
+ ## Testing
+ 
+ To verify Sentry is working after deployment:
+ 
+ ### 1. Test Client-Side Error
+ Add this to any React component:
+ ```javascript
+ throw new Error("Test client error");
+ ```
+ 
+ ### 2. Test Server-Side Error
+ Add this to any Astro page:
+ ```javascript
+ throw new Error("Test server error");
+ ```
+ 
+ ### 3. Test Function Error
+ Trigger an error in one of the API endpoints
+ 
+ Check errors at: https://sentry.io/organizations/bodegacatsgc/issues/
+ 
+ ## Performance Optimization
+ 
+ For production, consider adjusting sample rates to reduce Sentry quota usage:
+ 
+ In `sentry.client.config.ts` and `sentry.server.config.ts`:
+ - Reduce `tracesSampleRate` from 1.0 to 0.1 (10% of transactions)
+ - Reduce `replaysSessionSampleRate` from 0.1 to 0.05 (5% of sessions)
+ 
+ ## Documentation
+ 
+ See `SENTRY_SETUP.md` for:
+ - Detailed setup instructions
+ - Configuration options
+ - Troubleshooting guide
+ - How to adjust sample rates
+ - Error filtering options
+ 
+ ## Next Steps
+ 
+ 1. ✅ Verify `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` is set in Cloudflare Pages environment variables
+ 2. ⚠️ Update the project slug in `astro.config.mjs` (see Action Required section above)
+ 3. ✅ Deploy to Cloudflare Pages
+ 4. ✅ Test error tracking works in production
+ 5. 🔄 Adjust sample rates based on usage and quota
+ 
+ ## Support

Perfect! The Sentry integration is now complete. Here's a summary of what was implemented:

## ✅ Sentry Integration Complete

### What Was Done

1. **Installed Packages**
   - `@sentry/astro` - For client and server-side monitoring
   - `@sentry/cloudflare` - For Cloudflare Functions monitoring

2. **Created Configuration Files**
   - `sentry.client.config.ts` - Browser error tracking with Session Replay
   - `sentry.server.config.ts` - Server-side error tracking
   - `.sentryclirc` - Sentry CLI configuration

3. **Updated Core Files**
   - `astro.config.mjs` - Added Sentry integration with source maps
   - `src/middleware.ts` - Noted automatic Sentry middleware injection
   - `wrangler.toml` - Documented environment variables

4. **Enhanced All 4 Cloudflare Functions**
   - `functions/api/player-stats.ts`
   - `functions/api/team-stats.ts`
   - `functions/api/upload-direct.ts`
   - `functions/scheduled/update-player-ratings.ts`

5. **Created Documentation**
   - `SENTRY_SETUP.md` - Complete setup guide

### Coverage
✅ **Client-side** - Browser errors, performance, session replay  
✅ **Server-side** - SSR errors, API routes  
✅ **Cloudflare Functions** - All 4 functions instrumented  
✅ **Source Maps** - Configured for upload (needs correct project slug)

### ⚠️ Action Required

**Update the Sentry project slug** in `astro.config.mjs`:
1. Go to https://sentry.io/settings/bodegacatsgc/projects/
2. Find your project and note its slug
3. Update line 14 in `astro.config.mjs` with the correct slug

**Add to Cloudflare Pages Environment Variables:**
```
SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN=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
```

### Build Status
✅ **Build successful** - No linter errors  
✅ **Sentry initialized** - Ready to capture errors  
⚠️ **Source maps** - Will upload once project slug is corrected

+ 
+ ## Configuration Details
+ 
+ **Project**: proamrank (ID: 4510164326023168)  
+ **Organization**: bodegacatsgc  
+ **Environment**: production  
+ **DSN**: `https://15ecc8d420bd1ac21d6ca88698ca4566@o4509330775277568.ingest.us.sentry.io/4510164326023168`
+ 
+ ## Next Steps
+ 
+ ### 1. Add Environment Variable to Cloudflare Pages
+ 
+ **Required for production builds:**
+ 
+ Go to: Cloudflare Pages → proam-rankings → Settings → Environment variables
+ 
+ Add:
+ ```
+ SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN=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
+ ```
+ 
+ **Important**: Add to both Production and Preview environments!
+ 
+ ### 2. Deploy to Production
+ 
+ Once you deploy to Cloudflare Pages:
+ - Errors will automatically be captured and sent to Sentry
+ - Source maps will be uploaded during build
+ - You'll see readable stack traces in Sentry
+ 
+ ### 3. View Errors in Sentry
+ 
+ Access your Sentry dashboard:
+ - **Issues**: https://sentry.io/organizations/bodegacatsgc/issues/
+ - **Performance**: https://sentry.io/organizations/bodegacatsgc/performance/
+ - **Replays**: https://sentry.io/organizations/bodegacatsgc/replays/
+ 
+ ### 4. Test the Integration (Optional)
+ 
+ After deploying, test error capture:
+ 
+ **Client-side test**: Add to any React component:
+ ```tsx
+ throw new Error("Test client error from ProAm Rankings");
+ ```
+ 
+ **Server-side test**: Add to any Astro page:
+ ```astro
+ ---
+ throw new Error("Test server error from ProAm Rankings");
+ ---
+ ```
+ 
+ Visit the page, and the error should appear in Sentry within seconds!
+ 
+ ## Sample Rates (Currently Set)
+ 
+ - **Performance Traces**: 100% (all transactions captured)
+ - **Session Replays**: 10% of normal sessions
+ - **Error Replays**: 100% of sessions with errors
+ 
+ ### Adjusting for Production
+ 
+ If you want to reduce Sentry quota usage, edit these files:
+ 
+ **`sentry.client.config.ts`:**
+ ```typescript
+ tracesSampleRate: 0.1,  // Change to 10%
+ replaysSessionSampleRate: 0.05,  // Change to 5%
+ ```
+ 
+ **`sentry.server.config.ts`:**
+ ```typescript
+ tracesSampleRate: 0.1,  // Change to 10%
+ ```
+ 
+ ## Files Created/Modified
+ 
+ ### Created:
+ - `sentry.client.config.ts` - Client configuration
+ - `sentry.server.config.ts` - Server configuration
+ - `.sentryclirc` - Sentry CLI configuration
+ - `SENTRY_SETUP.md` - Setup guide
+ - `SENTRY_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - Implementation details
+ - `SENTRY_SUCCESS.md` - This file
+ 
+ ### Modified:
+ - `package.json` - Added Sentry packages
+ - `astro.config.mjs` - Added Sentry integration
+ - `src/middleware.ts` - Documented automatic Sentry injection
+ - `wrangler.toml` - Documented environment variable
+ - All 4 Cloudflare Functions - Added error capture

_**User (2025-10-10 03:02Z)**_

i need to throw the errors to complete the installation

---

_**Assistant (default)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user wants to test the Sentry integration by throwing test errors to complete the installation and verify everything is working. This is a good practice to ensure the integration is properly capturing and reporting errors.

I should help them create test errors for:
1. Client-side (browser/React)
2. Server-side (SSR/Astro pages)
3. API routes
4. Potentially a Cloudflare Function

I can create a simple test page or component that throws errors in different contexts. Let me create a dedicated test page for this purpose.</details></think>

---

I'll help you create test errors to verify the Sentry integration is working properly. Let me create a test page that will trigger errors in different parts of your application.

+ # 🧪 Sentry Testing Guide
+ 
+ Use this guide to verify your Sentry integration is working correctly.
+ 
+ ## Quick Test Page
+ 
+ I've created a dedicated test page at: **`/sentry-test`**
+ 
+ Visit: `http://localhost:4321/sentry-test` (dev) or `https://your-domain.com/sentry-test` (production)
+ 
+ ## Test Scenarios
+ 
+ ### 1. Client-Side Errors (Browser)
+ 
+ **Test Page Button**: "Throw Client Error"
+ 
+ **Manual Test**: Add this to any component:
+ ```javascript
+ throw new Error('[Test] Client-side error');
+ ```
+ 
+ **Expected in Sentry**:
+ - Error message with full stack trace
+ - Browser information (Chrome, Firefox, etc.)
+ - User agent details
+ - Breadcrumbs showing user actions

+ ### 2. Async Errors (Promises)
+ 
+ **Test Page Button**: "Throw Async Error"
+ 
+ **Manual Test**:
+ ```javascript
+ async function testAsync() {
+   await Promise.reject(new Error('[Test] Async error'));
+ }
+ ```
+ 
+ **Expected in Sentry**:
+ - Promise rejection error
+ - Async stack trace
+ - Context about when it was triggered
+ 
+ ---
+ 
+ ### 3. React Component Errors
+ 
+ **Interactive Component**: Available on test page
+ 
+ **Manual Test**: Create `src/pages/react-test.astro`:
+ ```astro
+ ---
+ import SentryTestComponent from '../components/SentryTestComponent';
+ ---
+ 
+ <html>
+   <body>
+     <SentryTestComponent client:load />
+   </body>
+ </html>
+ ```
+ 
+ **Expected in Sentry**:
+ - Component name and stack
+ - React component tree
+ - State information at time of error
+ - Props and context
+ 
+ ---
+ 
+ ### 4. Server-Side Errors (SSR)
+ 
+ **Manual Test**: Uncomment line 2 in `src/pages/sentry-test.astro`:
+ ```astro
+ ---
+ throw new Error('[Test] Server-side error');
+ ---
+ ```
+ 
+ Then visit `/sentry-test`
+ 
+ **Expected in Sentry**:
+ - Server-side error
+ - Request URL and headers
+ - Server environment info
+ - No browser information (server-only)
+ 
+ ---
+ 
+ ### 5. API Route Errors
+ 
+ **Test Endpoint**: `/api/sentry-test-error`
+ 
+ **Manual Test**:
+ ```bash
+ # GET request
+ curl http://localhost:4321/api/sentry-test-error
+ 
+ # POST request
+ curl -X POST http://localhost:4321/api/sentry-test-error \
+   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
+   -d '{"trigger":"error"}'
+ ```
+ 
+ **Expected in Sentry**:
+ - API route error
+ - HTTP method (GET/POST)
+ - Request headers
+ - Request body (for POST)
+ 
+ ---
+ 
+ ### 6. Cloudflare Function Errors
+ 
+ **Test**: Modify any function to throw an error temporarily
+ 
+ **Example** - `functions/api/player-stats.ts`:
+ ```typescript
+ export async function onRequest(context: { request: Request; env: Env }) {
+   // Add this at the top to test
+   throw new Error('[Test] Cloudflare Function error');
+   
+   // ... rest of code
+ }
+ ```
+ 
+ **Expected in Sentry**:
+ - Function name and location
+ - Cloudflare environment details
+ - Request information
+ 
+ ---
+ 
+ ## Verification Checklist
+ 
+ After triggering test errors, check your Sentry dashboard:
+ 
+ ### ✅ Error Appears in Issues

+ ---
+ 
+ ## Testing in Different Environments
+ 
+ ### Local Development (`npm run dev`)
+ 
+ 1. Start dev server: `npm run dev`
+ 2. Visit: `http://localhost:4321/sentry-test`
+ 3. Click test buttons
+ 4. Check Sentry dashboard
+ 
+ **Note**: Errors will be tagged with environment "production" (as configured)
+ 
+ ### Production (Cloudflare Pages)
+ 
+ 1. Deploy to Cloudflare Pages with `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` set
+ 2. Visit: `https://your-domain.com/sentry-test`
+ 3. Run all test scenarios
+ 4. Verify source maps are working (readable stack traces)
+ 
+ ---
+ 
+ ## Expected Sentry Dashboard Views
+ 
+ ### Issues Tab
+ ```
+ [Sentry Test] Client-side JavaScript error from button click
+   Environment: production
+   Browser: Chrome 120.0.0
+   Last seen: 2 minutes ago
+   
+   Stack Trace:
+     at HTMLButtonElement.click (sentry-test.astro:45:11)
+     at ... (readable source code)
+ ```
+ 
+ ### Performance Tab
+ ```
+ GET /sentry-test
+   Duration: 125ms
+   Status: 200
+   
+ Transaction breakdown:
+   - Browser: 95ms
+   - Server: 30ms
+ ```
+ 
+ ### Replays Tab
+ ```
+ Session Replay - Error occurred
+   Duration: 2m 34s
+   Errors: 1
+   
+   Timeline:
+     0:00 - Page loaded
+     0:15 - User clicked "Test Error" button
+     0:16 - ERROR: Client-side error thrown
+ ```
+ 
+ ---
+ 
+ ## Troubleshooting
+ 
+ ### Error Not Appearing in Sentry
+ 
+ 1. **Check DSN is correct** in config files
+ 2. **Verify SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN** is set (for source maps)
+ 3. **Check browser console** for Sentry errors
+ 4. **Ensure build succeeded** without Sentry errors
+ 5. **Wait 30-60 seconds** - Sentry may batch events
+ 
+ ### Source Maps Not Working
+ 
+ 1. **Verify SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN** is set in Cloudflare Pages
+ 2. **Check build logs** for "Successfully uploaded source maps"
+ 3. **Ensure project slug** is correct in `astro.config.mjs` (should be "proamrank")
+ 4. **Rebuild and redeploy** if token was added after initial deploy
+ 
+ ### Errors Appear Twice
+ 
+ - This is normal during development
+ - Sentry may capture errors from both HMR and actual runtime
+ - Won't happen in production builds
+ 
+ ---
+ 
+ ## Clean Up
+ 
+ After testing, you can:
+ 
+ 1. **Remove test page**: Delete `src/pages/sentry-test.astro`
+ 2. **Remove test component**: Delete `src/components/SentryTestComponent.tsx`
+ 3. **Remove test API**: Delete `src/pages/api/sentry-test-error.ts`
+ 
+ Or keep them for future testing!
+ 
+ ---
+ 
+ ## Next Steps
+ 
+ Once you've verified errors are being captured:
+ 
+ 1. ✅ Set up **Alert Rules** in Sentry to get notified of errors
+ 2. ✅ Configure **Issue Owners** for automatic assignment
+ 3. ✅ Set up **Slack/Email** integrations for notifications
+ 4. ✅ Adjust **sample rates** if needed to manage quota
+ 5. ✅ Create **filters** to ignore known issues (if any)
+

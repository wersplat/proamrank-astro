## Deployment Checklist

### Pre-Deployment

- [x] SQL migration files created
- [x] View definitions created
- [x] Mart updates completed
- [x] Documentation written
- [ ] SQL files reviewed for syntax errors
- [ ] Test migration on development database
- [ ] Verify existing queries still work

### Deployment Steps

1. **Backup Database**
   ```bash
   pg_dump your_database > backup_before_divisions_$(date +%Y%m%d).sql
   ```

2. **Apply Migration**
   ```bash
   psql -d your_database -f migrations/add_lg_divisions_table.sql
   ```

3. **Create View**
   ```bash
   psql -d your_database -f views/league_division_standings.sql
   ```

4. **Update Mart Definitions**
   ```bash
   # Apply each updated mart file
   psql -d your_database -f "marts/Player League Season Stats Mart.sql"
   psql -d your_database -f "marts/Team Analytics Data Mart.sql"
   psql -d your_database -f "marts/League Season Performance Mart.sql"
   ```

5. **Refresh Materialized Views**
   ```bash
   psql -d your_database -f migrations/refresh_marts_after_divisions.sql
   ```

6. **Regenerate TypeScript Types**
   ```bash
   npx supabase gen types typescript --project-id YOUR_PROJECT_ID > src/lib/db.types.ts
   ```

7. **Verify Deployment**
   ```sql
   -- Check table exists
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM pg_tables WHERE tablename = 'lg_divisions';
   
   -- Check view exists
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM pg_views WHERE viewname = 'league_division_standings';
   
   -- Check column exists
   SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns 
   WHERE table_name = 'team_rosters' AND column_name = 'division_id';
   ```

### Post-Deployment

- [ ] Test division creation
- [ ] Test team assignment to divisions
- [ ] Query division standings view
- [ ] Verify marts return division data
- [ ] Test frontend components (if applicable)
- [ ] Populate initial division data
- [ ] Monitor query performance
- [ ] Update frontend to display division info

## Backward Compatibility

✅ **All changes are backward compatible:**

1. **Nullable Fields** - All new fields are nullable
2. **LEFT JOINs** - Division joins don't exclude existing data
3. **Existing Queries** - Continue working without modification
4. **No Breaking Changes** - Teams without divisions show NULL
5. **Graceful Degradation** - UI can hide division info when NULL

## Testing Recommendations

### Unit Tests

```sql
-- Test 1: Create division
BEGIN;
INSERT INTO lg_divisions (name, season_id, league_id)
VALUES ('Test Division', 'test-season-id', 'test-league-id');
SELECT * FROM lg_divisions WHERE name = 'Test Division';
ROLLBACK;

-- Test 2: Assign team to division
BEGIN;
UPDATE team_rosters 
SET division_id = 'test-division-id'
WHERE team_id = 'test-team-id' AND season_id = 'test-season-id';
SELECT division_id FROM team_rosters WHERE team_id = 'test-team-id';
ROLLBACK;

-- Test 3: Query division standings
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM league_division_standings;

-- Test 4: Query marts with division fields
SELECT division_name FROM player_league_season_stats_mart LIMIT 1;
SELECT division_name FROM team_analytics_mart LIMIT 1;
SELECT division_stats FROM league_season_performance_mart LIMIT 1;
```

### Integration Tests

1. Create a test season
2. Create two divisions for the season
3. Assign teams to divisions
4. Play some matches
5. Refresh marts
6. Query division standings
7. Verify ranks and stats are correct

## Performance Impact

**Expected Performance:**
- Minimal impact on existing queries (additional LEFT JOINs)
- New indexes support efficient division lookups
- Materialized views maintain query performance
- Division standings view is lightweight

**Benchmarks to Monitor:**
- Query time for `player_league_season_stats_mart`
- Query time for `team_analytics_mart`
- Query time for `league_season_performance_mart`
- View refresh time for materialized views

## Known Limitations

1. **No Historical Division Tracking** - Only current division per roster entry
2. **Manual Division Assignment** - No automatic assignment logic
3. **Single Division per Team** - Teams can't be in multiple divisions simultaneously
4. **Season-Scoped** - Divisions are tied to seasons, not multi-season

## Future Enhancements

Potential additions (not included in this implementation):

1. **Division Playoff Brackets** - Track playoff seeding by division
2. **Inter-Division Stats** - Win/loss records against other divisions
3. **Division Strength Metrics** - Power rankings by division
4. **Division Championship Awards** - Track division winners
5. **Multi-Season Division History** - View for team division changes over time
6. **Auto-Assignment Rules** - Configurable rules for team placement
7. **Division Re-alignment** - Tools for moving teams between divisions

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur, rollback in reverse order:

```sql
-- 1. Drop view
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS league_division_standings;

-- 2. Revert mart changes (re-run old mart definitions)

-- 3. Remove column from team_rosters
ALTER TABLE team_rosters DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS division_id;

-- 4. Drop table
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS lg_divisions;

-- 5. Refresh materialized views
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW player_league_season_stats_mart;
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW team_analytics_mart;
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW league_season_performance_mart;
```

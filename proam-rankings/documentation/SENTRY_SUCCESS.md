## Configuration Details

**Project**: proamrank (ID: 4510164326023168)  
**Organization**: bodegacatsgc  
**Environment**: production  
**DSN**: `https://15ecc8d420bd1ac21d6ca88698ca4566@o4509330775277568.ingest.us.sentry.io/4510164326023168`

## Next Steps

### 1. Add Environment Variable to Cloudflare Pages

**Required for production builds:**

Go to: Cloudflare Pages â†’ proam-rankings â†’ Settings â†’ Environment variables

Add:
```
SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN=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
```

**Important**: Add to both Production and Preview environments!

### 2. Deploy to Production

Once you deploy to Cloudflare Pages:
- Errors will automatically be captured and sent to Sentry
- Source maps will be uploaded during build
- You'll see readable stack traces in Sentry

### 3. View Errors in Sentry

Access your Sentry dashboard:
- **Issues**: https://sentry.io/organizations/bodegacatsgc/issues/
- **Performance**: https://sentry.io/organizations/bodegacatsgc/performance/
- **Replays**: https://sentry.io/organizations/bodegacatsgc/replays/

### 4. Test the Integration

**ðŸ§ª Use the Test Page** (Recommended):

Visit **`/sentry-test`** in your browser:
- Development: `http://localhost:4321/sentry-test`
- Production: `https://your-domain.com/sentry-test`

The test page includes interactive buttons to trigger:
- âœ… Client-side errors
- âœ… Async/Promise errors
- âœ… API fetch errors  
- âœ… React component errors
- âœ… Manual error captures

**Or test manually**:

Client-side test:
```tsx
throw new Error("[Test] Client error from ProAm Rankings");
```

Server-side test - uncomment line 2 in `src/pages/sentry-test.astro`:
```astro
---
throw new Error("[Test] Server error from ProAm Rankings");
---
```

API Route test:
```bash
curl http://localhost:4321/api/sentry-test-error
```

Check errors at: https://sentry.io/organizations/bodegacatsgc/issues/

ðŸ“– **See `SENTRY_TESTING_GUIDE.md` for complete testing instructions**

## Sample Rates (Currently Set)

replaysSessionSampleRate: 0.05,  // Change to 5%
```

**`sentry.server.config.ts`:**
```typescript
tracesSampleRate: 0.1,  // Change to 10%
```

# Supabase Dashboard Deployment Guide

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note
The `DEPLOY_ALL_MARTS.sql` file uses psql-specific commands (`\ir`, `\echo`) that **won't work** in Supabase SQL Editor.

Instead, deploy each mart individually using the SQL Editor.

---

## üìã Deployment Checklist

Copy and paste each file's contents into Supabase SQL Editor in this order:

### Prerequisites ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ `event_strength_metrics_mv` exists (already deployed)
- ‚úÖ `v_matches_with_primary_context` exists (already deployed)

### Step 1: Verify Prerequisites

Run this to confirm both prerequisites exist:

```sql
-- Check event_strength_metrics_mv
SELECT COUNT(*) as event_strength_rows 
FROM event_strength_metrics_mv;

-- Check v_matches_with_primary_context
SELECT COUNT(*) as matches_with_context 
FROM v_matches_with_primary_context;

-- Both should return row counts > 0
```

If either fails, you need to create them first before proceeding.

### Step 2: Deploy Core Marts (in order)

   - [ ] Copy entire file contents
   - [ ] Paste into Supabase SQL Editor

## üéØ Quick Verification

After deploying all marts, run this in SQL Editor:

```sql
SELECT 
    matviewname AS view_name,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM pg_class WHERE oid = (schemaname || '.' || matviewname)::regclass::oid) > 0 AS has_data
FROM pg_matviews 
WHERE schemaname = 'public' 
AND (matviewname LIKE '%mart%' OR matviewname = 'event_strength_metrics_mv')
ORDER BY matviewname;
```

Should show 13 rows (12 new + event_strength_metrics_mv).

## üîß Create Indexes

After all marts are created, run this for each mart:

```sql
-- Player Performance Mart
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_player_perf_player_id ON player_performance_mart(player_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_player_perf_team ON player_performance_mart(current_team_id) WHERE current_team_id IS NOT NULL;
CREATE INDEX idx_player_perf_position_rating ON player_performance_mart(position, global_rating DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_player_perf_avg_points ON player_performance_mart(avg_points DESC) WHERE games_played >= 10;

-- Player Stats Tracking
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_player_stats_tracking_player_id ON player_stats_tracking_mart(player_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_player_stats_career_points ON player_stats_tracking_mart(career_points DESC);

```

## üìä Run ANALYZE

After creating indexes, optimize query planning:

```sql
ANALYZE player_performance_mart;
ANALYZE player_stats_tracking_mart;
ANALYZE team_analytics_mart;
ANALYZE match_analytics_mart;
ANALYZE league_season_performance_mart;
ANALYZE tournament_performance_mart;
ANALYZE head_to_head_matchup_mart;
ANALYZE player_hot_streak_mart;
ANALYZE team_momentum_indicators_mart;
ANALYZE achievement_eligibility_mart;
ANALYZE roster_value_comparison_mart;
ANALYZE player_league_season_stats_mart;
```

## ‚è∞ Set Up Auto-Refresh

Create this as a Supabase Edge Function or scheduled task:

```sql
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY player_stats_tracking_mart;
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY player_performance_mart;
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY team_analytics_mart;
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY match_analytics_mart;
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY league_season_performance_mart;
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY tournament_performance_mart;
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY head_to_head_matchup_mart;
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY player_hot_streak_mart;
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY team_momentum_indicators_mart;
